User Virtual address(segment(heap,code,data,stack)+offset)
kernel Virtual address(page+offset) = fragmentation will happens
linear address(page+offset) = page alloc,slab alloc, cache alloc
physical address(frame+offset)


List of utility macros in memory macros
-----------------------------------------

page_to_pfn(p) = its take the page discriptor and rturns frame number map to page
pfn_to_page()= returns page discriptor map to a page


__pa() = full 32 bit and 64 bit equivelent
__opa() = physical to logical 

to know the page size = PAGE_SIZE

PAGE_SHIFT = Number of bit present in address which represent the offset.
