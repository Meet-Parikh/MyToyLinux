Fragmemntation is not linier/not contigious.


you will get contigeous memory but that is the virtual memory address and physical memory is nott in contigious location

this is very slower . but it will give the large amout the memory

performance is very less

kernel virttual memory is leniear but physical address is not contigeous


--------------
vmalloc(6000);





sir doc:
-----


	- Built on top of page allocator
	-handles memory allocation requests of rendom sizes
	-returns virually contigueos memory by joining fragmemnts left over in pages
	-returns start kernel virtual address
	-returns start kernel virual address
	-reuirre unique page traslation table for each allocation, and is genrated at allocation time.

Routines : vmalloc, vfree
