1.Slab Allocators

	- Implemented as extension to page allocator
	- Handles memory allocators in multipules of 8 bytes
	(8,16,32,64,128... up to 4mb)
	- Always returns start linear address of a physically contigeous chunk 
	-fails if it cannot find the physically contigious chunk to process an allocation request.
	allocator routine


		-kmalloc and family of routines

				-kmalloc()
				-kzalloc()
				-krealloc()
				-kcalloc()
				-kfree()


if uh want 130 it will go to 2565

slab allocators its own free lists that we can called cache

so for each free list 

here no fresh allocation is occuring anywhere


every cache is start with 1 page. and dynamically it will extract

see the diagram of slab allocator


Every cache initially having below status 
-----------------------------------------

full slab
partially full slab
empty slab

slab is refer to array of objects.
and slab have a status full,partial or empty

you can see the info in 

cat /proc/slabinfo


sir doc:
--------



> The slab allocator group pages(object) into caches, which is a store for object of the same type(same size)
		-Examples : process descriptors,semaphores,inode , etc.

> A cache is divide into slabs . A slab consists of one or more contiguous page frames.A slab holds severral objects.


> A slab may be in ine of three possible states
	-Full : All Objects in the slabare marked as used.
	-Empty : All objects in the slab are marked as free.
	-Partially Full : the slab contains and free objects

> Slab Algorithm
	- The slab allocator first attempts to find a free object in partial slab.
	- If no such object exists, a free object is assigned from empty slab.
	- if no empty slab is available , a new slab is allocated using the buddy syatem allocator.

> Benifits of slabs
	-No (internal) fragmentation. The slab allocator gives the exct amount of memory that has been requested to 
	store an object.
	- Memory requests can be processed quickly. The released objects are only markeed as free and can quickly be reassigned.


note : if uh r using the low memory so uh can disable slab allocators.

3 types of slab versions are there uh can use any of the following based on the platform
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slob = diable all this mechanism direclty allocate the page low memory system
slub = locking required . this is for multicore
slab = old / this is optimal for signle core system
